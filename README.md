Django app test for a pizza delivery!


1. Index Page

    Display a list of products available for delivery.
    Each product should have an "Add to Cart" button.

2. Cart Functionality

    For anonymous users: Use a session key to identify the cart items.
    For authenticated users: Use the user's ID to associate cart items with their account.
    Implement functionalities to add, remove, and update quantities of items in the cart.

3. Cart View

    Show the items currently in the cart.
    Display the total price of all items in the cart.
    For authenticated users, include a button to proceed to checkout.
    For anonymous users, display a message or prompt to log in or create an account to proceed.

4. Checkout Process

    For authenticated users, clicking the checkout button should lead to the checkout page.
    For anonymous users, clicking the checkout button should redirect to the login or registration page.
    After successful login or registration, transfer the items from the anonymous cart to the user's cart.

5. Order Management

    Create a model for orders that includes details such as user ID, products, quantities, total price, and status.
    After successful checkout, create an order with the relevant details.
    Provide a view for users to see their order history and current order status.

6. Authentication

    Implement user authentication using a library like Django's built-in authentication system or a third-party solution like OAuth.
    Ensure that only authenticated users can access certain parts of the site, such as the checkout process.

7. Frontend and Backend Integration

    Implement frontend interfaces for all the functionalities mentioned above.
    Use AJAX or similar techniques for smooth interactions, such as adding items to the cart without refreshing the page.
    Implement backend logic to handle requests from the frontend, such as adding items to the cart, updating quantities, and processing orders.

8. Testing and Security

    Test the functionality thoroughly to ensure a smooth user experience and identify and fix any bugs.
    Implement security measures to protect user data, such as using HTTPS, input validation, and protecting against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

By following these steps, you should be able to create a basic delivery store with cart functionality that caters to both anonymous and authenticated users.
